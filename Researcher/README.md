## Why Researcher ? 😎

Researcher offers **high speed**, **data storage**, **automatic uninstallation** and combines **data analysis** in order to provide as much information as possible to the user. Plus, soon will have some interesting features such as: The user will have the choice to either set a specific country to search or the script will search automatically the followers of a user (which the user will specify) and separate them to categories in proportion to the country.

## Expected files 📁
The files expected to be created are:
  1) users_in_+loc+.txt   (the +loc+ will be replaced with the input location)
  2) cons.txt
