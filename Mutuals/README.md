# Mutuals 🧙

Mutuals is a powerful Python script designed to discover and display mutual followers and followings between two Instagram accounts. Whether you're looking to strengthen connections or gain insights into shared networks, Mutuals simplifies the process, allowing users to identify and connect with those who share mutual interests and connections on Instagram. **Mutuals works for both public and private accounts**.

## Why Mutuals ? 🧐

1. **Mutual Followers and Followings:** The script identifies and displays the accounts that both users A and B (the two Instagram accounts being compared) follow and are followed by. This helps users see who they have in common within their network.
2. **User-Friendly Interface:** Mutuals often provides a user-friendly interface or report that lists the mutual followers and followings in a clear and organized manner, making it easy for users to view and interact with this information.
3. **Comparison Metrics:** Some versions of Mutuals may offer additional metrics, such as the number of mutual followers, the number of mutual followings, and a list of these mutual accounts, allowing for a detailed analysis of the overlap in their Instagram networks.
4. **Filtering and Sorting:** Users may have the option to filter and sort the list of mutual followers and followings based on various criteria, such as engagement, account type, or recent activity.
5. **Exporting Data:** Mutuals exports the data and saves them into a text file.
6. **Notifications:** Mutuals provides notifications to users when new mutual followers or followings are identified or when changes occur in the mutual connections.
