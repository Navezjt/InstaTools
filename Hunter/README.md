# Hunter 🔫

**Short description:** Hunter tracks ghost followers on Instagram accounts, identifying users who follow but don't engage with content.

**Long description:** Hunter is a multifunctional Python script primarily designed for Instagram users. It serves as a tool for tracking ghost followers on Instagram accounts. Ghost followers are those who follow an account but don't engage with its content, such as liking or commenting. **Hunter works well with small accounts (500 followers or lower) but when dealing with larger numbers the execution time might increase.**
